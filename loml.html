        <p>
            <div>I hope you know how the past 31 days have been some of the happiest days of my life. You make me feel incredibly happy, 
                comforted, and loved. I know I say that a lot, but you signed up for this and I'll never stop saying how much you mean to me hahaha. 
                I love you so much, Cait. Thank you so much for being so caring and sweet even before we got together. You've been an amazing friend 
                even before we confessed and all this happened, and you helped me get through some of my saddest days, I love you.
